            <img src="assets/img/Foto.jpg" style="max-height: 40vh; margin-bottom: 2em;">

            <p>My name is Pablo Fernández, I am a <strong>video game developer</strong>, and I enjoy programming. The purpose of this website is to showcase my portfolio with my most notable projects, developed both individually and collaboratively. I have always had a passion for video games, but I did not discover programming until shortly before entering the video game development degree at the Complutense University of Madrid. Throughout the degree, I have learned many things, but I feel most comfortable when <strong>programming</strong>.</p>

            <p>I consider myself polite, friendly, and responsible. I have experience in <strong>teamwork</strong>, which is essential in this field, and I have completed various projects of different types.</p>

            <p>My goal is to join a company as a <strong>Junior Developer</strong> in a position that allows me to grow, learn, and enhance my skills.</p>

                    <p>As for the IDEs I have used the most, they include <strong>Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Android Studio</strong>. I have experience in managing projects and solutions in each of them. Regarding game engines, the one I have the most experience with is <strong>Unity</strong>, but I am also learning <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> with the goal of focusing on it. I have also used the <strong>SDL</strong> library and am proficient in it for rendering, input, audio, etc. I have experience with <strong>OGRE</strong>, a library with which we developed a 3D game engine in a group project. Lastly, in the "artistic" realm, I have used <strong>Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Blender</strong> quite extensively for 3D modeling.</p>

                        <p>This is a personal project whose intention is to learn <strong>Game Engine Development</strong>. Based on Shy Engine (Final Degree Project), it provides the essential funcionality for making 2D games.
                        Shy Engine is composed of three main parts: Core Engine (my part), World Editor, and Scripting System. For this project I isolated the Core Engine and started implementing new functionality. My goal is to learn about Graphics and Physics programming and code my own systems. Also make it 3D.

It is a 2D <strong>game engine and editor</strong> designed for <strong>non-programmers</strong>. The objective is to provide a tool for creating <strong>simple 2D games</strong> with a lower learning curve compared to the more commonly used engines today, focusing on individuals with <strong>limited experience</strong> in programming or game development in general.</p>

Each day, the player must use the daylight hours to <strong>search for essential items</strong> needed to survive in this harsh and cold environment. Additionally, during the night, the cold is so intense that you must return to the shelter to rest and <strong>manage your time and resources</strong>. Will you be able to escape the DOME?</p>

                        <p>Some minigames programmed using a PS4 Development Kit. They were implemented using CPU for rendering, using two threads: one for logic processing and the other for rendering. The logic thread sends render commands to the render thread, which then processes them. Communication was facilitated through a concurrent queue.</p>

Noteworthy features include the <strong>A* pathfinding algorithm</strong> on the homepage, the <strong>color wave</strong> at the top of this section, the user-customizable color palette and the missile battle. These are interesting programming challenges that bring the website to life and enhance its appearance.</p>
